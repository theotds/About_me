### 📅 How I started my adventure with coding

I enjoyed making sites and programming since one of my teachers showed me how to make sites in html and then i fell in love with it.

I started with making sites for a year in html and css (after 3 years of pause i restarted learning making sites, more difficult and now i started to learn JavaScript).
My first programming language i learned was C++ for 3 years (but just basics of programming and about class/objective programming).
Now i paused programming in C++, cause of my studies where we are learning to write in C what i enjoy too. At the first semester we had Python, and as you will see i 
have made my first bigger project in python in which i fell in love too.

So shortly i will focus a lot in making sites in html/css/JS and programming in C/Python

And that's all about me.
Feel free to give some feedback, if you would have some better solution, or improvements to my codes.
Thank you for your attention
